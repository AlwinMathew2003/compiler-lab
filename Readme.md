## Install Flex and Bison(Linux OS)
You can install Flex (a fast lexical analyzer) and Bison (a parser generator) using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install flex bison
```
## Verify Installation
After the installation is complete, you can verify that Flex and Bison have been installed correctly by checking their versions:
```bash
flex --version
bison --version
```
## How to Compile and Run Lex Program
1. **Save the code** to a file, e.g., `example.l`.
2. **Compile** the Lex program using Flex and GCC:  
    ```bash  
    lex file.l
    gcc lex.yy.c -lfl
    ```
3. **Run the executable**:
    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```
## How to Compiler and Run Lex and Yacc Program
1. **Save the lex code** to a file e.g., `example.l` and yacc code to another file e.g., `example.y`
2. **Compile the Lex program** using Flex:
    ```bash
    lex example.l
    ```
3. **Compiler the Yacc program** using Bison.
    ```bash
    yacc -dy example.y
    ```
4. **Run the executable**
    ```bash
    gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -lfl
    ```
